# Training and validation tests
The data in each folder here is divided into fifteen subfolders.
Each subfolder contains intensity patterns corresponding to VVBs generated as balanced superpositions of the form $|m1, H\rangle + e^{i\phi}|m2, V\rangle$ for different values of the phase $\phi$.
The names of the subfolders are associated with different $(m1, m2)$ combinations as follows:

-  c1 --- (-1, 1)
-  c2 --- (-3, 3)
-  c3 --- (-5, 5)
-  c4 --- (-5,-3)
-  c5 --- (-5,-1)
-  c6 --- (-5, 1)
-  c7 --- (-5, 3)
-  c8 --- (-3,-1)
-  c9 --- (-3, 1)
- c10 --- (-3, 5)
- c11 --- (-1, 3)
- c12 --- (-1, 5)
- c13 --- ( 1, 3)
- c14 --- ( 1, 5)
- c15 --- ( 3, 5)
